# Modules

All Sync code exists within a module. This module can be considered like a library or executable. It has types, functions, configuration, and dependencies.

Modules are constructed of a tree of source files/contents, functionally identical to a directory tree. Modules optionally may have a configuration file `sync.toml`. *TODO maybe `build.sync` would be better? Can write code to configure build stuff*

## Source Tree

A source tree is a collection of files within a module. This resembles a directory tree containing all sync source code files.
